## Readme

This project supports the "BC LEH Tool" Shiny application. The function of this tool is to improve the experience of B.C. resident hunters with the Limited Entry Hunt system. The project aims to do this by providing an easily navigable UI/UX that filtesr hunts based on specified criteria, such as species, season dates, hunter success, and more.

## Features

The Shiny application filters hunts by specified criteria and provides information on the hunts that meet those criteria in a leaflet map and a table. Map polygons are colour coded by either hunter success or draw odds, dependent on the user's selection.

Supporting code files are included to produce labels for LEH polygons and to process the raw data into a format for ingestion into the tool.

## Usage

Usage of the Shiny app is intended for B.C. residents interacting with the LEH draw system, or any other individuals who wish to better understand the data.

## Project Status

This project is near completion.
